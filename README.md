# R34PR EDR

Python Endpoint Detection and Response Project.

## About

This is, first and foremost, a learning project.

R34PR is **not intended** for real world use. It might get there eventually but
that's not really the plan for now.

---

These are my objectives with R34PR EDR:

- Python practice (of course)
- Deeper understanding of EDR internals and functions
- I will also be using this as a target for offensive testing.
